create course content export api,h3 api details proposed api course export a part a new api content content api include features identifying locating and controlling access files within a component subsystem are a part file storage api are served via one pluginfile php endpoints mdl 66006 mdl 69708 identifying locating and describing text areas within moodle and exporitng content stored within a component subsystem new api content api and _not_ a subsystem as expected become and integral parts moodle all core classes located core content namespace subsystems and components placing code and extensions api frankenstyle_component content content export api located within core content export namespace and subsystems and components placing code and extensions api frankenstyle_component content export h4 api components api made several core component types zipwriter located core content export zipwriter a wrapper around zipstream zipstream library and adds additional functionality and business logic related specifically export content also includes helpers add all pluginfiles relate a textarea rewriting pluginfile references textarea point exported files exporters located core content export exporters are classes perform work collecting all relevant content together and adding zipwriter a given context exportable items located core content export exportable_items and extending abstract core content export exportable_item class are helpers describe content exported and prepare export cover cases as export a single stored_file object all stored_file instances within a specific filearea file_storage api and ecport a text field within database exportable_items allow an indivdual component subsystem plugin describe an abstract way content include exportable item additionally includes logic actually add content describes zipwriter archive items exported located core content export exported_item provide a generic way a component describe exported a way used a human readable file includes features as a title shown user a list files and any string content typically a text field like a description relates exported item api designed support export _course_ content including activities at a sutiable time future would possible extend support export blocks within a course and parts site including course categories any arbitrary context h5 exporters exporters included core content export exporters as standard include abstract component_exporter all exporters must extend includes helpers used fetch context exported name component exported and zipwriter also includes helpers export a set exportable items describes a get_exportables function default returns an empty array abstract instance_exporter extends abstract component_exporter and intended extended activities implementing api example page component defines page content exporter extends instance_exporter class adds helpers fetching cm_info and activity name exporter used export generic data defined core required as intro feature activities _not_ an instance feature a part general api activities an activity support intro field declare supports feature and core handles rest class define list exportables rather takes list exportables an activity and handles export a feature core content export api and a part public api declared final and cannot extended called core api essentially calling code would look a little like following code foreach contexts as context component get_component_from_context context made function get name an activity context exportables fetch exportables activity instance defines classname component_exporter get_classname_for_component component class_exists classname exporter new classname context component user archive exportables exporter get_exportables pass core exporter handle remaining export modexporter new core content export exportables exporter context component user archive modexporter export_exportables exportables code export_exportables function responsible fetching module intro activity support adding all exportable content defined activity zipwriter and generating a human readable module index within zip archive course_exporter used export a whole course again a part public api and called core content return anything get_exportables function defines an export_course function takes a list all contexts successfully included export function adds course index zip stream includes all course sections and links activity within course an activity included downloaded content all links activity point module index created module_exporter an activity _not_ included downloaded content links point live site used future support cases a specific activity configured exported allows course structure remain and all data shown context activities exported point live site instead h6 course module exporters any individual activity course module define exporter included patch are page export content part a page activity folder export all files and folders within activity and resource export single file within activity activity extends core content export exporters instance_exporter class must override get_exportables function and function return a list exportable_item instances h5 exportable items exportable items are used describe all content exported an abstract and simplified way as reduce duplication across codebase all content exported as either text a collection files types are supported expected at time three standard item types are defined core fit a component able write exportable_item type activities likely export an exportable_textarea takes a table name field name and row id text areas files embedded also takes an optional filearea and itemid are used fetch file file storage api and an optional pluginfileitemid itemid used pluginfile php url adding archive all files filearea itemid added zip archive as file added content rewritten find any use pluginfile text relates specific file and rewrite point version stored zip archive after all files exported and content rewritten any remaining uses pluginfile are rewritten point live site using tokenpluginfile php endpoint allows viewing without requiring a current login activities purely export files two additional types defined exportable_stored_file allows a single file exported and exportable_filearea allows all files within a filearea itemid combination a specific component context combination exported h5 exported items order exported content adequately described a human readable format all exported content must described an exported_item includes a title any string content and two lists files consumed course_exporter and exporter create template data used mustache templates,2

notion of removable task in master code is inaccurate,past notion a removable task meant task terminal and acknowledged appears a removable task defined purely state terminal unreachable whether terminal update acknowledged as a result code calling function isremovable ends unintuitive one example a confusing piece code within updatetask logic says task removable recover resources remove seems intuitive directly described as task longer consuming resources e g transitioned terminal unreachable recover resources one looks documentation isremovable says a task becomes removable erased master primary task data structures accurate since function say whether terminal task acknowledged required a task removable think an easy improvement would move notion removable towards something like isterminalorunreachable could also think about name concept generally like canreleaseresources describe whether task resources are considered allocated introduce a notion isremovable seems saying whether task could removed master includes checking terminal tasks acknowledged,5
